our approach to mental health is the most simple and obvious ‚Äî ‚Äòyou‚Äô first

one part is about understanding your issues. help break your issues into manageable bits that‚Äôs easier to work with ‚Äî we call ‚Äúdiscomforts‚Äù. and the other part is providing just the right help you need for your discomforts ‚Äî we call ‚Äúmini-therapy‚Äù

<b>OKAY, BUT WHAT‚ÄôS A DISCOMFORT?</b>
a discomfort is anything that bothers you or you want to do something about. It could be a bad feeling, disturbing thought, difficult phase, or anything on your mind

it‚Äôs what you feel, think, overthink, and worry about. it‚Äôs not restricted to knowing exactly what you feel, but being unable to recognize your feelings is as much a discomfort as anything else

i feel anxious right now
i feel anxious about my looks and appearance
i am anxious about my productivity
i feel anxious before bed

don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre feeling

at the moment, our discomfort database, contributed by our users, stands at 18917. no discomfort is big or small. if it‚Äôs a discomfort for you ‚Äî there‚Äôs going to be a mini-therapy for that

<b>INTERESTING, WHAT‚ÄôS A MINI-THERAPY?</b>
a mini-therapy is a bite-sized therapy-like interactive session ‚Äî with a mix of audio-based counseling and tools/exercises ‚Äî hyper-personalized for every user and their discomforts

each mini-therapy is designed by our network of licensed professionals worldwide, specializing in the most diverse, scientific, and evidence-based approaches to therapy

together, we work with ACT, CBT, REBT, MBT, DBT, QACP, amongst others. using the best practices within these therapeutic approaches, such as thought reframing, goal-setting, disputing irrational beliefs, cognitive defusion, mindfulness visualizations, and so on ‚Äî alongside other commonly used techniques like journaling, self-compassion, and mindfulness tools such as visualization and breathing exercises

<b>IS IT EFFECTIVE?</b>
85% of our users have reported a deduction in their distress score after doing a mini-therapy and feeling better. we currently have a 92% success rate for our mini-therapies across all partners and issues

in numerous conversations with our users, they have reported feeling seen and understood using our tools that help them reflect on their lives

<b>CAN I WORK WITH JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE?</b>
well, we are adding newer issues every month. at the moment, we help you with issues surrounding anxiety and depression along with other related issues

here are some: general anxiety, social anxiety, procrastination, perfectionism, people-pleasing, self-criticism, self-esteem, fear of failure, productivity issues, fatigue ‚Äî emotional, mental, and physical, depression, burnout, sleep issues, anger, sexual issues, trust issues, imposter syndrome, self-sabotage, poor boundaries, amongst others

‚Ä¢ Get therapy on your own or with your partner
‚Ä¢ All therapists are licensed, trained, accredited and highly experienced in providing relationship support
‚Ä¢ Complete a short survey to be matched with a therapist who best fits your needs
‚Ä¢ Unlimited private communication with your therapist
‚Ä¢ Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger

<b>PROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU</b>
Relationship problems can be painful and challenging. Support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make big, positive changes. We created Regain so anyone can have convenient, discreet, and affordable access to professional help.
Common relationship problems people seek help for are difficulty communicating, high levels of conflict, disagreement over finances, children, or in-laws, and problems with infidelity, to name just a few.

<b>LICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS</b>
All therapists on Regain have at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced and accredited psychologists (PhD/PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials.

All of our therapists have a Master‚Äôs Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training and practice.

<b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>
After filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private ‚Äútherapy room‚Äù where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. Your partner will be invited to this room as well if you decide to try therapy together. You can also schedule a session so speak live with your therapist over video or phone.

You can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you‚Äôre facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights and guidance. This ongoing dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.

If you choose to try therapy on ReGain with your partner (either at the start of therapy, or if you choose to invite them later), your dialogue would be between all three of you: you, your partner, and your therapist. Together you will work towards making a positive change in your relationship and accomplishing your goals.

<b>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</b>
The cost of therapy through Regain ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your Regain membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the counseling service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.","<b>Get support for your relationship from a licensed therapist specializing in relationship therapy.</b> Connect with a therapist on your own terms - individually or alongside your partner.<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><b>REGAIN ‚Äì FEATURES</b><br>-------------------------------------------<br>‚Ä¢ Get therapy on your own or with your partner<br>‚Ä¢ All therapists are licensed, trained, accredited and highly experienced in providing relationship support<br>‚Ä¢ Complete a short survey to be matched with a therapist who best fits your needs<br>‚Ä¢ Unlimited private communication with your therapist<br>‚Ä¢ Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger<br><br><b>PROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU</b><br>Relationship problems can be painful and challenging.

‚óã Respond to a few of brief questions ‚óã Pair up with a therapist ‚óã share your suffering and start to heal!

‚óã Overcome depression, anxiety, addiction, or psychological pain with online therapy that is customized to your requirements and availability anytime, anywhere.
‚óã Happiness is achievable; by sharing what‚Äôs on your mind and speaking to a mental health therapist, you can regain it.
‚óã The easiest approach to get started on the road to profound happiness is to speak, call, or video chat with a real, live therapist.

<h3>Bringing therapy directly to you</h3>
High-end live chat features in the Therapy app allow users to speak with licensed mental health therapists one-on-one. Our skilled online therapists are able to assist you in this way, just as if you were both in the same room. Wherever you may be located, a therapist is prepared to come chat with you and offer assistance. Just for this, we've created a special chat interface, which will let you communicate without restriction via voice or chat with high quality and get therapy that could help you feel good.

<h3>You have the path to happiness in front of you; it consists of these easy steps:<h3>
1. Answer a brief questionnaire about yourself, your problems, and your therapeutic preferences.
2. Sign up and select a payment plan for your online therapy, which costs a fraction of the price of in-person counseling!
3. Be matched with a certified, knowledgeable mental health therapist.
4. You can talk to your therapist as much as you'd like, without limits ‚Äì it‚Äôs your choice if you want to chat, video-chat or have calls.
5. Get better ‚Äì for <b>you.</b>


<h3>Qualified therapists, easy to use</h3>
Online counseling is a great deal simpler than traditional treatment done in-person: you are immediately paired with a real therapist who specializes in your needs; and if you don't like them, changing advisers is as simple as clicking a few buttons. No more circling different therapists' offices in search of the ideal one, and no more trying out several sessions of getting mental health help before you find the right one.
Every single one of our therapists is legally licensed to practice therapy, counseling or psychology by their state board. You will undoubtedly discover a good fit with a counselor, since their fields of expertise and level of experience vary. We have therapists who specialize in treating people with depressive disorders, addictions, couples who need some therapy and anxiety disorders. Some of our therapists are also members of the LGBTQ+ community, and many of them have additional training in treating LGBTQ+ people. In addition, if you prefer, you can be paired with one of our more spiritual or religious therapists.

<h3>Keep your personal counseling life private</h3>
You don't have to tell anyone that you're using online therapy. You may communicate privately and anonymously with your live therapist at any time. Therefore ‚Äì unless you want them to ‚Äì no one has to know that you‚Äôre facing your demons. In this regard, if you‚Äôre struggling with social anxiety, the battle becomes especially easy when you use online therapy since chat and text are less socially-demanding than once a week in-person sessions.</h3></h3>","Download the &quot;Therapy&quot; app and accept the hand extended to assist you to regain control over your mind and improve your mental health.<br><br>‚óã Respond to a few of brief questions ‚óã Pair up with a therapist ‚óã share your suffering and start to heal!<br><br>‚óã Overcome depression, anxiety, addiction, or psychological pain with online therapy that is customized to your requirements and availability anytime, anywhere.<br>‚óã Happiness is achievable; by sharing what‚Äôs on your mind and speaking to a mental health therapist, you can regain it.<br>‚óã The easiest approach to get started on the road to profound happiness is to speak, call, or video chat with a real, live therapist.<br><br><h3>Bringing therapy directly to you</h3><br>High-end live chat features in the Therapy app allow users to speak with licensed mental health therapists one-on-one.

<b>VOICE WILL HELP YOU</b>

You no longer have to struggle to focus when meditating. Let yourself go and allow your imagination to run wild! You'll get all the effects of meditation without actually having to meditate.


<b>EASIER THAN MEDITATION. FASTER RESULTS</b>

- Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.

- You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.


<b>HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPON</b>

We like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.

Luckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.

Your subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.

For example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again.
You become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.

Unlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.


<b>BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUES</b>

Hypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.


<b>HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS</b>

- lower anxiety and stress levels
- get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits
- boost your energy
- increase self-motivation
- improve mental health

Meditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!

<h1><b>Feel Better with Mooditude</b></h1>

Getting started is easy, and many members can have their first visit within 20 minutes of signing up!

1. Tell us a bit about your symptoms by answering a few short questions.
2. Select a plan that suits your needs. Membership plans include prescription services, therapy, or a combination of both.
3. Get on a video/phone call with one of our prescribing mental health providers.
4. Chat with your counselor.
5. Receive any prescribed medications within just a few days.
6. Have regular check-ins with your mental health provider and counselor.

Cerebral can have positive impacts on your mental health and well-being, just like it has for so many of our patients. Here‚Äôs what a few of them are saying:

‚ÄúMy therapist suggested I consider antidepressants months ago, but the cost to see a psychiatrist was too high. So I just didn‚Äôt try antidepressants at all for awhile. Since my therapist referred me to Cerebral, I get to talk not only to my prescribing doctor but also to a care counselor who makes herself available to answer all of my questions.‚Äù - Alex M

‚ÄúWhat an easy way to access really awesome care. Cerebral makes it easy - and my doctor and care counselor really care about me.

Flow represents a new chapter in the understanding and treatment of depression, based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research.

The app can be used on its own and offers a therapy programme with over 50 therapy sessions. The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural therapy and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test.

Together with the Flow brain stimulation headset, the app offers a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app. 

The Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com

The programme contains over 50 sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as:

- Exercise

Physical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow will tell you what type of exercise is beneficial and the optimal ‚Äúdose‚Äù.

- Meditation

Meditation is practised by many people around the world as mental ‚Äúexercise‚Äù for the brain. Flow will give you concrete exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.

- Sleep

Did you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.

- Nutrition

The nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression.

^ feels like nothing matters.

^ feels like it will never get better

treatments and self-help skills to deal with depression. Health care professionals give
depression treatments, but you can learn self help skills and apply them to your own life. This guide teaches a set of antidepressant skills you can use to overcome depression. Sometimes the skills can be used on their own, when the depression
isn‚Äôt too severe. Sometimes they have to be used along with treatments by professionals.

Depression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders.

It feels the most powerful when you start wanting to do it.

Join over 2 million users and learn to ride the wave with the free Calm Harm app by choosing activities from these categories: Comfort, Distract, Express Yourself, Release, and Random.

There is also a breathing technique to help be mindful and stay in the moment, regulate difficult emotions and reduce tension.

When you ride the wave, the urge to self-harm will fade.

Calm Harm is an award-winning app developed for teenage mental health charity stem4 by Clinical Psychologist Dr. Nihara Krause, in collaboration with young people, using principles from the evidence-based Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). It is built to NHS standards and approved by ORCHA.

Calm Harm provides some immediate techniques to help break the cycle of self-harm behaviours and explore underlying trigger factors; build a ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô of helpful thoughts, behaviours and access to supportive people; and provides the opportunity to journal and self-reflect. It also provides signposts to help.

The Calm Harm app is private, anonymous and safe.

Please note that the Calm Harm app is not a substitute for the assessment and individualised treatment by a health/mental health professional.

Please also note that if you forget both your passcode and security answer, these cannot be reset as we do not create user accounts. You will need to reinstall the app, losing any previous data.

Calm Harm has been given a new look and updated to the latest technology. We‚Äôve listened to users and enhanced the app‚Äôs functionality, adding the ability to make journal entries at any time and the option to select multiple reasons for your urge to self-harm after completing an activity. We‚Äôve also updated and expanded the choice of activities based on user suggestions. 

What else is new?
‚Ä¢	Users can add activities to a ‚ÄòFavourites‚Äô list.
‚Ä¢	The mascots are now enhanced by animations throughout the app.
‚Ä¢	Choose from a wider selection of colour schemes.
‚Ä¢	Easier access to immediate help via the breathe activity, both during onboarding and in the footer of the app itself.
‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve removed the option to set a passcode to access the whole app and, instead, the self-monitoring section can now be passcode-protected or accessed via facial recognition / Touch ID.
‚Ä¢	Tours explaining key features of the app.

What is staying the same?
‚Ä¢	The app is clinically-developed by a Consultant Clinical Psychologist in collaboration with young people.
‚Ä¢	Optional passcode-protection (though now only for the self-monitoring section).
‚Ä¢	Users choose 5-minute or 15-minute activities (from the same categories as before), counted down by a timer, that are based on the principles of a treatment technique called Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT).
‚Ä¢	Users can still record experiences in the log section (now called My Records) and see information such as weekly average urge strength, most common urges, and most active time of day.
‚Ä¢	The app is completely free, with no in-app purchases required.
‚Ä¢	Users are shown signposts to further help.
‚Ä¢	Our commitment to data privacy and user anonymity.
‚Ä¢	No need for data or WiFi access to use the app.
‚Ä¢	Built to UK National Health Service standards and approved by ORCHA.
‚Ä¢	Users can still personalise their experience.

The module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.

The module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only ‚Äì switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚Äöbox breathing‚Äò technique‚Äì full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.

Another feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)

The module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).

The SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‚Äòs life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.

In the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again ‚Äì the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.

In the last module ‚Äì PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES ‚Äì there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. 

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. 

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.<br><br>With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.<br><br>To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.<br><br>And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.<br><br>Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:<br><br>1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL<br><br>A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. <br><br>In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. <br><br>The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. <br><br>You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.<br><br>2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS<br><br>If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. <br><br>Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. <br><br>They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.<br><br>The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. <br><br>You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.<br><br>Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.<br><br>3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS<br><br>Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board.

The daily affirmation help rewire our brains, build self esteem and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.

Positive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.

An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.
The more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.

As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.

And the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.
There are so many benefits of using the affirmation as part of your daily morning routine:

- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. 

- An affirmation defines your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. 

- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.
